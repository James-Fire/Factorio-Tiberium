menu_Factorio-Tiberium=Factorio and Conquer
title_Factorio-Tiberium=Factorio and Conquer
mod_page=Welcome to Factorio and Conquer! \n Here is where we will explain the mechanics and machines of the mod.

menu_tiberium_growth=Tiberium Growth
title_tiberium_growth=Tiberium Growth
tiberium_growth=Tiberium in the world is not static like other ores. It grows over time. Nodes grow every 5 minutes, on a separate timer from other nodes. \nTiberium Ore damages the player, based on how many tiles of ore you are near. 0.1 damage for each tile in a 1.5 tile radius.

menu_nodes=Nodes
title_nodes=Nodes
nodes=Tiberium grows from nodes in the world. A node grows every 5 minutes, on a separate timer from other nodes. Be careful, the tiberium damages you, and placement damages buildings. \nNew nodes can be made by tiberium growth. There is a chance that a growth makes a node instead of adding to the tile. This chance is increased by there being more ore on the target tile. This chance is 0 if the target tile is under the Tiberium Spread value.

menu_growth_accelerator=[item=tiberium-growth-accelerator]Growth Acceleration
title_growth_accelerator=Growth Acceleration
growth_accelerator=The Growth Accelerator is a way to use excess material, by feeding it to tiberium to make the field grow faster. These use Tiberium Substrate, which are made using ores.\nPlaced on nodes, these constantly use Tiberium Substrate to build up a charge, which is then released when the node grows.

menu_harvesting=Tiberium Harvesting
title_harvesting=Tiberium Harvesting
harvesting=In addition to vanilla mining drills, the mod provides several ways to harvest tiberium, some more permanent than others. \nMining tiberium is fairly simple. Belts, miners, and power poles are immune to the damage from tiberium growth, so that you can freely place them to mine tiberium.

menu_node_harvester=[item=tiberium-node-harvester]Node Harvester
title_node_harvester=Node Harvester
node_harvester=The Node Harvester is a way to get rid of unwanted nodes. It mines them out, removing them permanently. It may take a while, if the node is rich.

menu_tiberium_spike=[item=tiberium-spike]Tiberium Spike
title_tiberium_spike=Tiberium Spike
tiberium_spike=The Tiberium Spike allows safe exploitation of tiberium. When you place one of these on a node, it covers it completely, stopping growth, while harvesting Molten Tiberium.

menu_tiberium_control_node=[item=tiberium-network-node]Tiberium Network Node (TNN)
title_tiberium_control_node=Tiberium Network Node (TNN)
tiberium_control_node=The TNN is the pinnacle of mass mining of tiberium, doing it in a large area extremely quickly. It does not mine out nodes, however.

menu_tiberium_seed=[item=tiberium-seed]Liquid Tiberium Seed
title_tiberium_seed=Liquid Tiberium Seed
tiberium_seed=The Liquid Tiberium Seed is a missile that spreads tiberium. Firing it at a location creates tiberium ore in a 2 tile radius, including diagonal. Further tiles get less ore. If a Seed would cause a tile to go above the maximum ore per tile (1000 by default), a Node is created instead, allowing tiberium growth.

menu_aoe_node_harvester=[item=tiberium-aoe-node-harvester]AOE Node Harvester
title_aoe_node_harvester=Node Harvester
aoe_node_harvester=The AOE Node Harvester is a way to get rid of many unwanted nodes. It mines them out, removing them permanently. It may take a while, if the nodes are rich.

menu_tiberium_control_network=[item=tiberium-beacon-node]Tiberium Control Network
title_tiberium_control_network=Tiberium Control Network
tiberium_control_network=The Tiberium Control Network is a powerful beacon structure, improving the mining speed of nearby tiberium harvesting equipment. \n\nEach building can only be affected by a max of 3 beacons. The base increase per beacon is 100% speed, and 200% power usage. This can be increased by 25% and 40% respectively for each level of the Tiberium Control Network Power tech. In addition, there is a 5MW power requirement for each entity that is affect by at least 1 beacon. \n\nThe following entities are affected by this: \n-Tiberium Spike \n-Tiberium Node Harvester \n-Tiberium Network Node \n-AOE Node Harvester

menu_refining=Tiberium Refining
title_refining=Tiberium Refining
refining=Refining tiberium is a multi-step process, with some byproducts along the way.

title_tiberium_ore=Tiberium Ore
tiberium_ore=Tiberium ore is the base material. It can either be centrifuged or refined into Slurry. It can also be burned as fuel. \nHolding ore in your inventory damages you. This also applies to ore in your trash slots.

menu_sludge=[fluid=tiberium-sludge]Sludge
title_sludge=Sludge
sludge=Sludge is the main byproduct of tiberium refining. It is produced by each refining step, and is optional in Direct Recipes.\nWhile it is less valuable than the refined Tiberium, it still has multiple uses.

menu_slurry=[fluid=tiberium-slurry]Slurry Tiberium
title_slurry=Slurry Tiberium
slurry=Slurry is the first step of refining tiberium. This step occurs in Assembling Machines, and can then be used for either centrifuging, or refining into Molten.

menu_molten=[fluid=molten-tiberium]Molten Tiberium
title_molten=Molten Tiberium
molten=Molten is the second step of tiberium refinement. This step occurs in Refineries. Molten Tiberium can be used in Direct Recipes to directly produce single ores in large amounts, centrifuged for a calculated ratio of materials, or refined into Liquid.

menu_liquid=[fluid=liquid-tiberium]Liquid Tiberium
title_liquid=Liquid Tiberium
liquid=Liquid Tiberium is the last refining product. It is used in weaponry, power production, and seeding more tiberium. Power production can be direct usage in a Power Plant, packing into fuel cells for use in Nuclear power, and just burning it as a fluid with a fuel value. \nUtilizing fuel cells to feed a nuclear reactor is a multi-step process. The empty cells must be made, then they are filled with Liquid. After usage in a Reactor, they are then dirty and need to be cleaned. This process also filters out any that might be damaged, or otherwise unusable, so you need to make sure you keep making spares.

menu_centrifuging=[item=centrifuge]Centrifuging
title_centrifuging=Centrifuging
centrifuging=Centrifuging can be done from Ore, Slurry, Molten, or Liquid and produces a calculated ratio of ores for a predefined stage of the game. \nThe current ratios are decided by the requirements of the science packs in 3 tiers: Pre-Oil, Pre-Rocket, and then whatever is needed for repeatables. However, the calculation is not perfect, so please report anything you think it odd.

menu_containment=Containment
title_containment=Containment
containment=The mod has several methods of containing tiberium for when you don't want to harvest it, as well as equipment to protect yourself from it.

menu_armor=[item=power-armor-mk2]Armour
title_armor=Armour
armor=The mod includes 2 tiers of protection against tiberium contact damage. Tiberium Military 1 significantly reduces the amount of environmental damage taken from tiberium, while Tiberium Military 3 grants complete immunity to environmental damage from tiberium as long as you are wearing power armor.

menu_sonic_fences=[item=tiberium-srf-emitter]Sonic Fencing
title_sonic_fences=Sonic Fencing
sonic_fences=Sonic fencing is a passive method for controlling tiberium. Simply place the fences, up to 15 tiles apart, and a fence of sonic energy will be generated between them. This fence prevents tiberium from growing past it. This fencing also impacts growth, causing any tiberium it blocks to be reduced by 50%, and then placed on the tile closer to the node it came from.

menu_MARV=[item=tiberium-marv]MARV
title_MARV=Mammoth Armoured Reclamation Vehicle
MARV=The MARV is your ultimate weapon against tiberium. By merely driving over the ore, the MARV clears the ground, harvesting some of the tiberium into it's inventory, and also replenishing its fuel supplies.

menu_weaponry=Tiberium Weaponry
title_weaponry=Tiberium Weaponry
weaponry=The mod has several weapons based on tiberium technology. Since tiberium is explosive, it sees use in missiles, and with the ability to ionize easily, it is perfect for ion particle beams.

menu_ion_projector=[item=tiberium-ion-turret]Ion Beam Projector
title_ion_projector=Ion Beam Projector
ion_projector=Tiberium is effective at ionizing particles for use in ion particle beams. This is used to make a more effective laser turret, essentially.

menu_tiberium_missiles=[item=tiberium-rocket]Tiberium Missile Weapons
title_tiberium_missiles=Tiberium Missile Weapons
tiberium_missiles=The mod adds 2 missile weapons based on Tiberium's explosive power. The first is merely a beefy missile, doing some extra Tiberium damage over the normal missile. The other is a Liquid Tiberium Bomb, with a larger radius, and more damage than the Vanilla Nuke.
